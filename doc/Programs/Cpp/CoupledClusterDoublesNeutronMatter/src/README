Makefile should make everything correctly.
Debug flags are currently on.
A minimal example code to run is
./main.exe 1 0.08 1 3 14 4

The code tells you what each input number means.
In this case
1 = Run infinite nuclear matter with minnesota potential
0.08 = 0.08 nucleons per fm^-3
1 = Neutrons only (2 for symmetric matter)
3 = Number of basis shells
14 = Number of particles
4 = Check to see if the code uses more than 4Gb memory
