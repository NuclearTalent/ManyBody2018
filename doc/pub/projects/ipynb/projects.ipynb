    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An essential element of the Talent courses is to develop a large\n",
    "project(s) which allows you to study and understand theoretical\n",
    "concepts in nuclear physics.  These concepts will in turn allow you to\n",
    "interpret results from experiments and understand the pertinent\n",
    "physics in terms of the underlying forces and laws of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the regular lectures in the morning, the hope is that\n",
    "during these three weeks you will be able to write and run a program\n",
    "which implements at least one of the methods discussed during the\n",
    "lectures.  The lectures will also cover additional material which aims\n",
    "at giving you a broader view on what can be achieved with the methods\n",
    "to be discussed. Combined with the 'hands-on' afternoon sessions, the\n",
    "hope is that the lectures and the computational projects will together\n",
    "allow you to achieve these goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided in four main parts. The first part deals with\n",
    "a simple pairing model and the development of a shell-model program\n",
    "related to this model.  This program can then serve as a benchmark\n",
    "program for the Coupled Cluster theory and in-medium SRG codes to be\n",
    "developed. The latter form the remaining parts of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not used version control before now, it is time to do so.\n",
    "Proper version control is central to a good ethical scientific conduct.\n",
    "We do require that you use some kind of version control software when working on the projects. We recommend strongly [github](https://github.com/). All lectures and additional material are available at the github [address of the course](https://github.com/NuclearTalent/ManyBody2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, before coming to the course, we recommend that you refresh your knowledge on second quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some basic ingredients for a successful numerical project\n",
    "\n",
    "When building up a numerical project there are several elements you should think of, amongst these we take the liberty of mentioning the following:\n",
    "  1. How to structure a code in terms of functions\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. How to make a module\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. How to read input data flexibly from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. How to create graphical/web user interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. How to write unit tests (test functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only), in our case you think of a system and a solver class\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:\n",
    "1. New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Programs are run through convenient user interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to form working\n",
    "groups consisting of typically three (or more) participants. Every\n",
    "group should establish its own Github or Gitlab repository for the\n",
    "project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1, pairing problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the  project we will thus work with a simplified Hamiltonian consisting of a one-body operator and a so-called \n",
    " pairing interaction term. It is a model which to a large extent mimicks some central features of\n",
    "atomic nuclei, certain atoms and systems which exhibit superfluiditity or superconductivity.  \n",
    "Pairing plays a central role in nuclear physics, in particular, for identical particles it makes up large fractions of the correlations among particles. The partial wave $^{1}S_0$ of the nucleon-nucleon force plays a central role in setting up pairing correlations in nuclei. Without this particular partial wave, the $J=0$ ground state spin assignment for many nuclei with even numbers of particles would not be possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We define first the Hamiltonian, with a definition of the model space and\n",
    "the single-particle basis. Thereafter, we present the various steps which are needed to develop a shell-model program for studying the pairing problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian acting in the complete Hilbert space (usually infinite\n",
    "dimensional) consists of an unperturbed one-body part, $\\hat{H}_0$,\n",
    "and a perturbation $\\hat{H}_I$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We limit ourselves to at most two-body interactions, our Hamiltonian  is \n",
    "then represented by the following operators"

Write a class which holds single-particle data like specific quantum numbers, single-particle Hamiltonian etc. Write also a class which sets up and stores two-body matrix elements defined by the single-particle states.  Write thereafter functions/classes which implement the coupled cluster method with doubles only.\n",
