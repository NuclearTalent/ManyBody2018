    "i.e. total momentum and total spin projection. Let us consider the\n",
    "$T_2$ amplitude. It can be written as\n",
    "$t_{ij}^{ab}(S_{12}^z,K_{12})$. Here, we identified a given channel by\n",
    "its total momentum, i.e. $k_i + k_j = K_{12} = k_a +k_b$, and by its\n",
    "total spin projection, i.e. $s_i +s_j = S_{12}^z = s_a +s_b$.  For a\n",
    "given reference state, we can thus determine all possible total\n",
    "momenta $K_{12} = k_i + k_j$, and we can determine all possible\n",
    "$S_{12}^z$. Each allowed combination of $(K_{12},S_{12})$ labels a\n",
    "single channel. We also have all possible hh states\n",
    "$\\vert ij(K_{12},S_{12})\\rangle$, and their number is\n",
    "$D_{hh}(K_{12},S_{12})$. As the interaction preserves\n",
    "$(K_{12},S_{12})$, we can then seek all pp states\n",
    "$\\vert ab(K_{12},S_{12})\\rangle$ corresponding to this channel. Their\n",
