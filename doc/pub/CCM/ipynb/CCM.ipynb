Topologically different diagrams differ in the number and type of lines (particle or hole) that connect the Fock matrix $F$ or the interaction $V$ to the cluster amplitudes $T$, but not whether these connections are left or right (as those are related by antisymmetry). As an example, all diagrams in Fig. [fig-symmetry](#fig-symmetry) are topologically identical, because they consist of incoming particle and hole lines and of outgoing particle and hole lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write down the matrix elements that enter the diagram, and sum over all internal lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The overall sign is $(-1)$ to the power of [(number of hole lines) - (number of loops)].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Symmetry factor: For each pair of equivalent lines (i.e. lines that connect the same two operators) multiply with a factor $1/2$. For $n$ identical vertices, multiply the algebraic expression by the symmery factor $1/n!$ to account properly for the number of ways the diagram can be constructed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Antisymmetrize the outgoing and incoming lines as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this really works. You could derive these rules for\n",
    "yourself from the commutations and factors that enter the\n",
    "Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The sign comes obviously from the\n",
    "arrangement of creation and annilhilation operators, while the\n",
    "symmetry factor stems from all the different ways, one can contract\n",
